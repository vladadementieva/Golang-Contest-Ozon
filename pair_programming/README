The company employs n developers, where n is an even number. The crazy manager decided to break all the developers into teams of two people.
To do this, he made a list of all developers and assigned each of them a number on the list (from 1 to n) and the value ai â€” the skill level of the i-th developer in the list.
The process of creation of every new team looks like:
1) The first developer on the team is the one who comes first on the list;
2) The pair for the first developers have the smallest difference of skills. If there are few pair canditates, then choice for the closest in list.
3) Then thae pair of developers are created new team and removed from list.
