There is a promotion in the store: "buy three of the same product and pay only for two."
Of course, each product purchased can participate in only one promotion.
The promotion can be used multiple times.
For example, if 7 goods of one type are purchased at a price of 2 per piece and 5 goods of another type at a price of 3 per piece, then instead of 7⋅2+5⋅3, you will have to pay 5⋅2+4⋅3=22.
Assuming that only the same goods have the same prices, find the amount payable.
Incomplete solutions to this problem (for example, insufficiently effective) can be assessed with a partial score.

Input data
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Next are the input data sets. Each one starts with a line that contains n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of items purchased. The next line contains their prices p1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤104). If the prices of two goods are the same, then we must assume that this is one and the same product.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n values ​​over all tests does not exceed 2⋅105.
Output
Print t integers — the amounts to be paid for each of the test cases.
